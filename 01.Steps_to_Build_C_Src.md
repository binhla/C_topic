# 4 steps to build a C source code

From a C source code to a excutable file, there are 4 steps: 

__preprocessor__ -> __compiler__ -> __asembler__ -> __linker__

## preprocessor
- Remove all comment
- Execute preprocessor intruction: #include; #if .. #else ...; #define; ...

## compiler
- Translate preprocessor **C code** into **Assembly code**
- Output **Assembly files** (.asm)

## asembler
- Translate **Assembly code** into **Machine code**
- Output **Object files** (.o)

## linker
- Link **Object files** to create program
- Asembler cannot assign absolute memory location to all the intruction & data in a file. It writes some ***notes*** about how it assumed things were layout.
- Linker use these ***notes*** to assign absolute memory location to everythings.
- Output **Binary excutable** (.out)
