# Pointer and Const

## Pointer to constant
The data pointed by the pointer is constant and cannot be changed.
The pointer itself can change and points somewhere else.

```c
int main() {
    const int *p = NULL;
    const int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    
    p = &x;
    printf ("pointer to %d\r\n", *p);
    
    p = &y;
    printf("pointer to %d\r\n", *p);
    
    return 0;
}
```

```c
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    const int *p = &x;
    
    *p = 20;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Constant pointer
The pointer fixed to a fixed memory location. 
The value at that location can be changed.

```c
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int* const p = &x;
    printf("pointer to %d\r\n", *p);
    
    *p = 20;
    printf("pointer to %d\r\n", *p);
    
    return 0;
}
```
>pointer to 10
>pointer to 20

## Constant pointer to constant
The data pointed to by the pointer is constant and cannot be changed.
The pointer itself cannot be changed.

```c
int main() {
    int x = 10, y = 20;
    const int* const p = &x;
    printf("pointer to %d\r\n", *p);
    
    //*p = 20; /*Changing data value is not allowed*/
    //p = &y; /*Changing pointer is not allowed*/
    return 0;
}
```
